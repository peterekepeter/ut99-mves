Quickstart
==========

1. Copy necessary files

    - copy the `.u` files into to the `System/` folder

    - copy the `.int` file:
        - on 436 into the `System/`
        - on 469 into the `SystemLocalized/int/`

    - copy the configuration `.ini` file:
        - on Windows this is the `System/` folder
        - on Linux `~/.utpg/System` unless `-nohomedir` is specified

2. Add the client package to ServerPackages inside UnrealTournament.ini:

    ServerPackages=MVE2dev

3. Start your server with mapvote enabled:

    ucc server DM-Deck16][?Mutator=MVES.MapVote

4. Whenever you want the map list to be updated you need to run the reload 
command the reload command will re-scan paths for maps and will match them 
against filters

    adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    mutate bdbmapvote reload

After these steps are done, in game you should be able to make the vote window
show up by either typing `!v` in chat or `mutate bdbmapvote votemenu` in console.


Troubleshooting
===============


1. Map vote window does not show up:

    A. Check for `[MVE] Map Vote Extended version:` in the server log. If you do
    not see this log then the server component of mapvote did not start. Check 
    your server startup script and make sure it contains `?Mutator=MVES.MapVote`

    B. Check that ServerPackages from UnrealTournament.ini contains MVE2dev.
    This package contains the vote window. If it's missing then clients will 
    not download and are not able to display the mapvote window in game.

    C. Do or did you have another mapvote? It's possible that some part of it
    is still active and that it's blocking some functionality of this mapvote. 
    Make sure that the other mapvote doesn't start. 
    Try installing MVE to a clean version of UT99 


2. Map vote window shows up but it's empty:

    A. Did you copy the `MVE_Config.ini`? If you did not then you'll start
    with an empty config without any map filters. This also an okay way to start
    you can copy parts from the `MVE_Config.ini` provided in the zip.

    B. Is `MVE_Config.ini` is in the right place? It's possible that it's not
    getting loaded. Try setting `bReloadOnNextRun=True` and run the server again
    The next run should set `bReloadOnNextRun` back to `False` if it doesn't then
    you're editing the wrong configuration file.

    C. Double check your map filters. Use the example config file from the zip
    file should at least match all maps starting with DM-* and those should be 
    visible. Run `mutate bdbmapvote reload` this will re-scan your disk and it 
    also print any errors to the server log. Check the server log for errors
    MVE will print out configuration problems found during map list reload.

If the above did not work ytou can reach out to the communityt. 
You can report bugs or ask for help in the thread:

Configuration
=============

To make good use of this mapvote you need to edit `MVE_Config.ini`
You will need to learn how to use the config file.
This can only be done through experiment and practice.
Always make small changes and test it.
Once you got a good config, make a backup of it.


Adding More Maps
================

New maps you add to the game are not automatically detected. 

If you add a new map then you need to reload the map list.
If you do not reload, the same old map list is sent to the players.
The classic way is running the `mutate bdbmapvote reload` command.
To run it you need to be logged in as admin.

    adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    mutate bdbmapvote reload

Alternatively a reload can be triggered from the config file MVE_Config.ini 
This is useful so that you can reload the map list without entering the game.

    bReloadOnNextRun=True


Adding Custom Gametypes
=======================

New game types are not automatically detected.
You need to edit MVE_Config and define the new gametypes. 
The easiest way is to copy paste an existing one and edit it.

To set up a different gametype you need to set the correct GameClass.
For CTF4 this could be GameClass="CTF4.CTF4Game" but depends on which CTF4 you're using

Here is the modified gametype below

    CustomGame[4]=(bEnabled=True,GameClass="CTF4.CTF4Game",...)

If you make a change then again you need to reload the map list.
If you do not reload then the same old games list is sent to players.


Useful Keybinds
===============

I recommend setting up 3 keybinds. These are optional you can do everything
without them, but it speeds things up a bit.

    set input f8 mutate bdbmapvote votemenu
    set input f9 adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    set input f10 mutate bdbmapvote reload

Now press the f9 key and then press f10 key to quickly reload the map list 
when you install or remove maps.

You can also press f8 to bring up the vote menu in game at any moment without
having to wait for the match to end.

You can ofcourse choose different keys to bind to.

Note: if you logged in as admin, you can force a map swicth!


Advanced Installation
=====================

- If bOverrideServerPackages=True then MapVote will manage ServerPackages for
you and will automatically add the user interface package MVE2dev to ServerPackages
By default bOverrideServerPackages=True but if you have set 
bOverrideServerPackages=False you will need to manually add the client package 
yourself to ServerPackages:

[Engine.GameEngine] 
ServerPackages=MVE2dev


- MapVote can be installed both in mutator or server actor mode. This will 
affect the initialization order a bit. This will influence initialization of 
other mutators. Ultimately this is a choice for you to use whichever mode is
more comfortable working with. Here are some ways you can run MapVote:

    1) as server actor, edit UnrealTournament.ini add the following:

    [Engine.GameEngine]
    ServerActors=MVES.MapVote

    1) as server mutator start the server with the following:
    
    ucc server DM-Agony?mutator=MVES.MapVote

    2) single player / standalone you can run the game with arguments:

    UnrealTournament.exe CityIntro?mutator=MVES.MapVote -log


- The installation package should come with a MVE_Config.ini file. This is 
provided as a convenience of good defaults and a baseline configuration. If
you feel lost or misconfigured something, you can use it as a reference to 
set things back to good defaults. If you already have a configuration file 
make sure you don't override it when installing updates. It's also a good 
practice to keep backups of this file or to put it under version control.


- If you use Notepad++ to edit your configuration files then we have a 
user defined language configuration for MVE_Config.ini which has better 
delimitation of key-values, brackets and parenthesis and it also identifies 
known mapvote configuration properties. To install it, go to the menu
Language > User Defined Language > Define your language... and then
import `Map Vote Extended Notepad++.xml`


Good luck!
