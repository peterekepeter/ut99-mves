Quickstart
==========

1) Copy necessary files

    - copy the `.u` files into to the `System/` folder

    - copy the `.int` file:
        - on 436 into the `System/`
        - on 469 into the `SystemLocalized/int/`

    - copy the configuration `.ini` file:
        - on Windows this is the `System/` folder
        - on Linux `~/.utpg/System` unless `-nohomedir` is specified

2) Start your server with mapvote enabled:

    ucc server DM-Deck16][?Mutator=MVES.MapVote

3) Whenever you want the map list to be updated you need to run the reload command
the reload command will re-scan paths for maps and will match them against filters

    adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    mutate bdbmapvote reload

Configuration
=============

To make good use of this mapvote you need to edit `MVE_Config.ini`
You will need to learn how to use the config file.
This can only be done through experiment and practice.
Always make small changes and test it.
Once you got a good config, make a backup of it.


Adding More Maps
================

New maps you add to the game are not automatically detected. 

If you add a new map then you need to reload the map list.
If you do not reload, the same old map list is sent to the players.
The classic way is running the `mutate bdbmapvote reload` command.
To run it you need to be logged in as admin.

    adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    mutate bdbmapvote reload

Alternatively a reload can be triggered from the config file MVE_Config.ini 
This is useful so that you can reload the map list without entering the game.

    bReloadOnNextRun=True


Adding Custom Gametypes
=======================

New game types are not automatically detected.
You need to edit MVE_Config and define the new gametypes. 
The easiest way is to copy paste an existing one and edit it.

To set up a different gametype you need to set the correct GameClass.
For CTF4 this could be GameClass="CTF4.CTF4Game" but depends on which CTF4 you're using

Here is the modified gametype below

    CustomGame[4]=(bEnabled=True,GameClass="CTF4.CTF4Game",...)

If you make a change then again you need to reload the map list.
If you do not reload then the same old games list is sent to players.


Useful Keybinds
===============

You can set up some keybinds so that you can quickly reload in game.
With keybinding you can run any command.
To reload the map list from keybind you will need 2 commands on keybind.

    set input f9 adminlogin yoursecretpassword
    set input f10 mutate bdbmapvote reload

With these set up you can log in by pressing f9 then f10 to reload.


Advanced Installation
=====================

- If bOverrideServerPackages=True then MapVote will manage ServerPackages for
you and will automatically add the user interface package MVE2h to ServerPackages
By default bOverrideServerPackages=True but if you have set 
bOverrideServerPackages=False you will need to manually add the client package 
yourself to ServerPackages:

[Engine.GameEngine] 
ServerPackages=MVE2h


- MapVote can be installed both in mutator or server actor mode. This will 
affect the initialization order a bit. This may influence initialization of 
other mutators. Ultimately this is a choice for you to use whichever mode is
more comfortable working with. Here are some ways you can run MapVote:

    1) as server actor, edit UnrealTournament.ini add the following:

    [Engine.GameEngine]
    ServerActors=MVES.MapVote

    1) as server mutator start the server with the following:
    
    ucc server DM-Agony?mutator=MVES.MapVote

    2) single player / standalone you can run the game with arguments:

    UnrealTournament.exe CityIntro?mutator=MVES.MapVote -log


- The installation package should come with a MVE_Config.ini file. This is 
provided as a convenience of good defaults and a baseline configuration. If
you feel lost or misconfigured something, you can use it as a reference to 
set things back to good defaults. If you already have a configuration file 
make sure you don't override it when installing updates. It's also a good 
practice to keep backups of this file or to put it under version control.


- If you use Notepad++ to edit your configuration files then we have a 
user defined language configuration for MVE_Config.ini which has better 
delimitation of key-values, brackets and parenthesis and it also identifies 
known mapvote configuration properties. To install it, go to the menu
Language > User Defined Language > Define your language... and then
import `Map Vote Extended Notepad++.xml`


Good luck!
